# Compiler Project - Adding a Custom Variable Type

This project aims to add a custom variable type, named "BALKAYA," to a compiler design. This README.md document outlines the fundamental steps to integrate the "BALKAYA" variable type into your language. The project is developed in Python.

## Steps

### 1. General Language Design

Define the overall structure of the language by specifying how the "BALKAYA" type will be used and its behavior. This includes determining the syntax and semantics of the language.

### 2. Lexer (Token Analysis)

The lexer interprets the source code to understand the syntax and produces special tokens to define variables of type "BALKAYA."

### 3. Parser (Tree Construction)

The parser uses the tokens generated by the lexer to construct a tree structure. It determines how variables of the "BALKAYA" type will be represented within this tree.

### 4. Semantic Analysis

During semantic analysis, apply specific semantic rules for the "BALKAYA" type to the created tree structure. This includes how the variable is used, assignment operations, and other custom behaviors.

### 5. Code Generation

Finally, using the information obtained from semantic analysis, generate machine code suitable for the target platform. This transforms variables of the "BALKAYA" type into a format understandable by the target platform.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the "BALKAYA" variable type into your language, enhancing your compiler design.

*Note: The choice of the name "BALKAYA " for the custom variable type is inspired by my last name, giving the compiler a touch of personal charm.*
